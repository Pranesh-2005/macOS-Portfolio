# About Me

## Introduction

Hey there! 👋

I'm a B.Tech student at the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://www.bitsathy.ac.in) department of [Bannari Amman Institute of Technology](https://www.btsathy.ac.in/).

🚀 Passionate about Open Source, I've contributed to various organizations, helping build and improve projects that benefit the community. Coding for Open Source is not just a hobby for me — *it's a way of life!*

💻 As a self-taught AIML developer, I've honed my skills through building diverse projects, constantly evolving and embracing new technologies.

🌱 Currently diving deep into LLM, Generative AI, and MCP, while also working on building my own LLM.

🤝 Always excited to collaborate on impactful Open Source projects.

Let's build something amazing together! 🌟
